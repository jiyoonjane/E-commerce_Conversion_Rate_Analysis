# E-commerce_Conversion_Rate_Analysis
# Introduction: Project Background 

## Project Overview
I’m on the Partner Analytics team at a leading cosmetics e-commerce platform, where I help partner brands grow through data-driven insights. Recently, Grattol—the second highest-earning brand on our site—asked me to analyze their performance and recommend ways to boost their sales.

Although Grattol already ranks #2 in revenue, its purchase conversion rate lags behind competitors. It remains unclear whether low conversion is the primary driver of unrealized revenue. This project seeks to diagnose the root causes of under-optimized sales for Grattol and to recommend actionable, data-backed improvements.

## Background: Grattol’s Situation & Problem Statement

> **Note:**  
> **Goal:** Analyze the full revenue funnel—including conversion rate issues—and deliver practical growth strategies for Grattol.

### EDA Workflow & Problem Definition

#### 👀 Step 1: Understand Platform Revenue

> The platform hosts over 1,000 brands. Since the top four brands together account for more than 30% of total revenue, our comparisons focus on those leading brands.

#### 👀🧭 Step 2: Questioning the Phenomenon  
- **Observation:** Grattol ranks #2 in total sales but shows a disproportionately low conversion rate.  
- **Why It Matters:** High traffic and brand interest fail to translate into purchases, revealing clear opportunities for optimization.

### Problem Definition
- **Discrepancy:** High page views vs. low purchase conversion.  
- **Paradox:** Strong revenue performance (#2 overall) but a conversion gap compared to peers.  
- **Improvement Opportunity:** Excessive drop-off in the funnel indicates actionable areas to raise conversions.

## Analysis Focus
1. **Funnel Diagnostics**  
   - Measure conversion rate, average order value, and buyer count vs. visitor count to pinpoint revenue drag.  
2. **Event-Log Behavior Mapping**  
   - Reconstruct the customer journey through clickstream data to identify where and why drop-offs occur.

> **Key Finding:**  
> Grattol’s conversion rate is up to **6.7 percentage points** lower than competitors despite high sales volume.
